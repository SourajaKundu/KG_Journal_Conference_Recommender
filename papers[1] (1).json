        "Abstract": "Deploying neural networks (NNs) in low-resource domains is challenging because of their high computing, memory, and power requirements. For this reason, NNs are often quantized before deployment, but such an approach degrades their accuracy. Thus, we propose the counterexample-guided neural network quantization refinement (CEG4N) framework, which combines search-based quantization and equivalence checking. The former minimizes computational requirements, while the latter guarantees that the behavior of an NN does not change after quantization. We evaluate CEG4N on a diverse set of benchmarks, including large and small NNs. Our technique successfully quantizes the networks in the chosen evaluation set, while producing models with up to 163% better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "Title": "RouteNet-Fermi: Network Modeling With Graph Neural Networks",
        "Abstract": "Network models are an essential block of modern networks. For example, they are widely used in network planning and optimization. However, as networks increase in scale and complexity, some models present limitations, such as the assumption of Markovian traffic in queuing theory models, or the high computational cost of network simulators. Recent advances in machine learning, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), are enabling a new generation of network models that are data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviors. In this paper, we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goals as Queuing Theory, while being considerably more accurate in the presence of realistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts accurately the delay, jitter, and packet loss of a network. We have tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of increasing size (up to 300 nodes), including samples with mixed traffic profiles \u2014 e.g., with complex non-Markovian models \u2014 and arbitrary routing and queue scheduling configurations. Our experimental results show that RouteNet-Fermi achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive packet-level simulators and scales accurately to larger networks. Our model produces delay estimates with a mean relative error of 6.24% when applied to a test dataset of 1,000 samples, including network topologies one order of magnitude larger than those seen during training. Finally, we have also evaluated RouteNet-Fermi with measurements from a physical testbed and packet traces from a real-life network.",

        "Title": "RGP: Neural Network Pruning Through Regular Graph With Edges Swapping",
        "Abstract": "Deep learning technology has found a promising application in lightweight model design, for which pruning is an effective means of achieving a large reduction in both model parameters and float points operations (FLOPs). The existing neural network pruning methods mostly start from the consideration of the importance of model parameters and design parameter evaluation metrics to perform parameter pruning iteratively. These methods were not studied from the perspective of network model topology, so they might be effective but not efficient, and they require completely different pruning for different datasets. In this article, we study the graph structure of the neural network and propose a regular graph pruning (RGP) method to perform a one-shot neural network pruning. Specifically, we first generate a regular graph and set its node-degree values to meet the preset pruning ratio. Then, we reduce the average shortest path-length (ASPL) of the graph by swapping edges to obtain the optimal edge distribution. Finally, we map the obtained graph to a neural network structure to realize pruning. Our experiments demonstrate that the ASPL of the graph is negatively correlated with the classification accuracy of the neural network and that RGP has a strong precision retention capability with high parameter reduction (more than 90%) and FLOPs reduction (more than 90%) (the code for quick use and reproduction is available at https://github.com/Holidays1999/Neural-Network-Pruning-through-its-RegularGraph-Structure ).",

        "Abstract": "In this brief, we consider the problem of descriptors construction for the task of content-based image retrieval using deep neural networks. The idea of neural codes, based on fully connected layers\u2019 activations, is extended by incorporating the information contained in convolutional layers. It is known that the total number of neurons in the convolutional part of the network is large and the majority of them have little influence on the final classification decision. Therefore, in this brief, we propose a novel algorithm that allows us to extract the most significant neuron activations and utilize this information to construct effective descriptors. The descriptors consisting of values taken from both the fully connected and convolutional layers perfectly represent the whole image content. The images retrieved using these descriptors match semantically very well to the query image, and also, they are similar in other secondary image characteristics, such as background, textures, or color distribution. These features of the proposed descriptors are verified experimentally based on the IMAGENET1M dataset using the VGG16 neural network. For comparison, we also test the proposed approach on the ResNet50 network.",

        "Title": "Tuning Convolutional Spiking Neural Network With Biologically Plausible Reward Propagation",
        "Abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically inspired learning principles than those in standard artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system\u2019s intelligent nature.",

        "Title": "Generating Neural Networks for Diverse Networking Classification Tasks via Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search",
        "Abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are widely used in classification-based networking analysis to help traffic transmission and system security. However, there are heterogeneous network devices (e.g., switches and routers) in a network. Manually customizing NNs with specific device requirements (e.g., max allowed running latency) can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Furthermore, the diverse data characteristics of different networking classification tasks add to the burden of NN customization. This paper introduces Loong, a neural architecture search (NAS) based system that automatically generates NNs for various networking tasks and devices. Loong includes a neural operation embedding module, which embeds candidate neural operations into the layer to be designed. Then, the layer-wise training is used to generate a task-specific NN layer by layer. This layer-wise scheme simultaneously trains and selects candidate neural operations using gradient feedback. Finally, only the important operations are selected to form the layer, maximizing accuracy. By incorporating multiple objectives, including deployment memory and running latency of devices, into the training and selection of NNs, Loong is able to customize NNs for heterogeneous network devices. Experiments show that Loong's NNs outperform 13 manual-designed and NAS-based NNs, with a 4.11% improvement in F1-score. Additionally, Loong's NNs achieve faster (7.92X) speeds on commodity devices.",

Specifically, in this paradigm, parts of an ML process are outsourced to multiple distributed UEs. Then, the processed information is aggregated on a certain level at a central server, which turns a centralized ML process into a distributed one and brings about significant benefits. However, this new distributed ML paradigm raises new risks in terms of privacy and security issues. In this article, we provide a survey of the emerging security and privacy risks of distributed ML from a unique perspective of information exchange levels, which are defined according to the key steps of an ML process, i.e., we consider the following levels: 1) the level of preprocessed data; 2) the level of learning models; 3) the level of extracted knowledge; and 4) the level of intermediate results. We explore and analyze the potential of threats for each information exchange level based on an overview of current state-of-the-art attack mechanisms and then discuss the possible defense methods against such threats.

        "Abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and flexible loads in smart grids, a more complicated power system with high uncertainty is gradually formed, which brings about great challenges to smart grid operations. Traditional optimization methods usually require accurate mathematical models and parameters and cannot deal well with the growing complexity and uncertainty. Fortunately, the widespread popularity of advanced meters makes it possible for smart grid to collect massive data, which offers opportunities for data-driven artificial intelligence methods to address the optimal operation and control issues. Therein, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has attracted extensive attention for its excellent performance in operation problems with high uncertainty. To this end, this article presents a comprehensive literature survey on DRL and its applications in smart grid operations. First, a detailed overview of DRL, from fundamental concepts to advanced models, is conducted in this article. Afterward, we review various DRL techniques as well as their extensions developed to cope with emerging issues in the smart grid, including optimal dispatch, operational control, electricity market, and other emerging areas.

        "Title": "Efficient Acceleration of Deep Learning Inference on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices: A Review",
        "Abstract": "Successful integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) or deep learning (DL) has resulted in breakthroughs in many areas. However, deploying these highly accurate models for data-driven, learned, automatic, and practical machine learning (ML) solutions to end-user applications remains challenging. DL algorithms are often computationally expensive, power-hungry, and require large memory to process complex and iterative operations of millions of parameters. Hence, training and inference of DL models are typically performed on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in the cloud. Data transmission to the cloud results in high latency, round-trip delay, security and privacy concerns, and the inability of real-time decisions. Thus, processing on edge devices can significantly reduce cloud transmission cost. Edge devices are end devices closest to the user, such as mobile phones, cyber\u2013physical systems (CPSs), wearables, the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded and autonomous systems, and intelligent sensors. These devices have limited memory, computing resources, and power-handling capability. Therefore, optimization techniques at both the hardware and software levels have been developed to handle the DL deployment efficiently on the edge. Understanding the existing research, challenges, and opportunities is fundamental to leveraging the next generation of edge devices with artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Mainly, four research directions have been pursued for efficient DL inference on edge devices: 1) novel DL architecture and algorithm design; 2) optimization of existing DL methods; 3) development of algorithm\u2013hardware codesign; and 4) efficient accelerator design for DL deployment. This article focuses on surveying each of the four research directions, providing a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art tools and techniques for efficient edge inference.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML), especially deep neural networks, has achieved great success, but many of them often rely on a number of labeled samples for supervision. As sufficient labeled training data are not always ready due to, e.g., continuously emerging prediction targets and costly sample annotation in real-world applications, ML with sample shortage is now being widely investigated. Among all these studies, many prefer to utilize auxiliary information including those in the form of knowledge graph (KG) to reduce the reliance on labeled samples. In this survey, we have comprehensively reviewed over 90 articles about KG-aware research for two major sample shortage settings\u2014zero-shot learning (ZSL) where some classes to be predicted have no labeled samples and few-shot learning (FSL) where some classes to be predicted have only a small number of labeled samples that are available. We first introduce KGs used in ZSL and FSL as well as their construction methods and then systematically categorize and summarize KG-aware ZSL and FSL methods, dividing them into different paradigms, such as the mapping-based, the data augmentation, the propagation-based, and the optimization-based. We next present different applications, including not only KG augmented prediction tasks such as image classification, question answering, text classification, and knowledge extraction but also KG completion tasks and some typical evaluation resources for each task. We eventually discuss some challenges and open problems from different perspectives.",

Recent unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in the development of advanced mobile platforms with new imaging devices. Traditional imaging systems based on the \u201ccapturing images first and processing afterward\u201d mechanism cannot meet this explosive demand. On the other hand, computational imaging (CI) systems are designed to capture high-dimensional data in an encoded manner to provide more information for mobile vision systems. Thanks to AI, CI can now be used in real-life systems by integrating deep learning algorithms into the mobile vision platform to achieve a closed loop of intelligent acquisition, processing, and decision-making, thus leading to the next revolution of mobile vision. Starting from the history of mobile vision using digital cameras, this work first introduces the advancement of CI in diverse applications and then conducts a comprehensive review of current research topics combining CI and AI. Although new-generation mobile platforms, represented by smart mobile phones, have deeply integrated CI and AI for better image acquisition and processing, most mobile vision platforms, such as self-driving cars and drones only loosely connect CI and AI, and are calling for a closer integration. Motivated by this fact, at the end of this work, we propose some potential technologies and disciplines that aid the deep integration of CI and AI and shed light on new directions in the future generation of mobile vision platforms.",

        "Abstract": "Multitask learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while exploiting their mutual relationships. By using shared resources to simultaneously calculate multiple outputs, this learning paradigm has the potential to have lower memory requirements and inference times compared to the traditional approach of using separate methods for each task. Previous work in MTL has mainly focused on fully supervised methods, as task relationships (TRs) can not only be leveraged to lower the level of data dependency of those methods but also improve the performance. However, MTL introduces a set of challenges due to a complex optimization scheme and a higher labeling requirement. This article focuses on how MTL could be utilized under different partial supervision settings to address these challenges. First, this article analyses how MTL traditionally uses different parameter sharing techniques to transfer knowledge in between tasks. Second, it presents different challenges arising from such a multiobjective optimization (MOO) scheme. Third, it introduces how task groupings (TGs) can be achieved by analyzing TRs. Fourth, it focuses on how partially supervised methods applied to MTL can tackle the aforementioned challenges.

        "Abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining has achieved remarkable success in high-level vision, but its application in low-level vision remains ambiguous and not well-established. What is the primitive intention of pretraining? What is the core problem of pretraining in low-level vision? In this paper, we aim to answer these essential questions and establish a new pretraining scheme for low-level vision. Specifically, we examine previous pretraining methods in both high-level and low-level vision, and categorize current low-level vision tasks into two groups based on the difficulty of data acqui-sition: low-cost and high-cost tasks. Existing literature has mainly focused on pretraining for low-cost tasks, where the observed performance improvement is often limited. However, we argue that pretraining is more significant for high-cost tasks, where data acquisition is more challenging. To learn a general low-level vision representation that can improve the performance of various tasks, we propose a new pretraining paradigm called degradation autoencoder (De-gAE). DegAE follows the philosophy of designing pretext task for self-supervised pretraining and is elaborately tai-lored to low-level vision. With DegAE pretraining, SwinIR achieves a 6.88dB performance gain on image dehaze task, while Uformer obtains 3.22dB and 0.54dB improvement on dehaze and derain tasks, respectively.",

However, in this paper, we show that appropriate usage of dropout benefits SR networks and improves the generalization ability. Specifically, dropout is better embedded at the end of the network and is significantly helpful for the multi-degradation settings. This discovery breaks our common sense and inspires us to explore its working mechanism. We further use two analysis tools - one is from a recent network interpretation work, and the other is specially designed for this task. The analysis results provide side proofs to our experimental findings and show us a new perspective to understand SR networks.",

Most modern approaches in TAL divide this problem into two parts: i) feature extraction for action recognition; and ii) temporal boundary for action localization. In this study, we focus on improving the performance of the TAL task by exploiting the feature extraction effectively. Specifically, we present a temporal triplet algorithm in order to enhance temporal density-dependence information for the input video clips. Moreover, the multiview fusion framework is taken into account for enriching action representation. For the evaluation, we conduct the proposed method on the 2023 AI City Challenge Dataset.

We study regression from images to parameter values and here it is common to detect uncertainty by predicting probability distributions. In this context, we investigate the regression-by-classification paradigm which can represent multimodal distributions, without a prior assumption on the number of modes. Through experiments on a specifically designed synthetic dataset, we demonstrate that traditional loss functions lead to poor probability distribution estimates and severe overconfidence, in the absence of full ground truth distributions. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose hinge-Wasserstein \u2013 a simple improvement of the Wasserstein loss that reduces the penalty for weak secondary modes during training. This enables prediction of complex distributions with multiple modes, and allows training on datasets where full ground truth distributions are not available. In extensive experiments, we show that the proposed loss leads to substantially better uncertainty estimation on two challenging computer vision tasks: horizon line detection and stereo disparity estimation.",

        "Abstract": "When capturing and storing images, devices inevitably introduce noise. Reducing this noise is a critical task called image denoising. Deep learning has become the de facto method for image denoising, especially with the emergence of Transformer-based models that have achieved notable state-of-the-art results on various image tasks. However, deep learning-based methods often suffer from a lack of generalization ability. For example, deep models trained on Gaussian noise may perform poorly when tested on other noise distributions. To address this issue, we present a novel approach to enhance the generalization performance of denoising networks, known as masked training. Our method involves masking random pixels of the input image and reconstructing the missing information during training. We also mask out the features in the self-attention layers to avoid the impact of training-testing inconsistency. Our approach exhibits better generalization ability than other deep learning models and is directly applicable to real-world scenarios. Additionally, our interpretability analysis demonstrates the superiority of our method.",

However, the performance is not reliable for images with challenging factors, such as heavy occlusion, motion blur, etc. In this work, we propose to understand human attributes using video frames that can make full use of temporal information. Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt pre-trained big models CLIP to extract the feature embeddings of given video frames. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the attribute list as another input and transform the attribute words/phrase into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for language embedding. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction.

        "Abstract": "Blind image inpainting is a crucial restoration task that does not demand additional mask information to restore the corrupted regions. Yet, it is a very less explored research area due to the difficulty in discriminating between corrupted and valid regions. There exist very few approaches for blind image inpainting which sometimes fail at producing plausible inpainted images. Since they follow a common practice of predicting the corrupted regions and then inpaint them. To skip the corrupted region prediction step and obtain better results, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture for blind image inpainting consisting of wavelet query multi-head attention transformer block and the omni-dimensional gated attention. The proposed wavelet query multi-head attention in the transformer block provides encoder features via processed wavelet coefficients as query to the multi-head attention. Further, the proposed omni-dimensional gated attention effectively provides all dimensional attentive features from the encoder to the respective decoder. Our proposed approach is compared numerically and visually with existing state-of-the-art methods for blind image inpainting on different standard datasets. The comparative and ablation studies prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach for blind image inpainting.

Our analysis reveals that the TM, with just one clause, can converge correctly to the intended logical operator, learning from training data over an infinite time horizon. Besides, it can capture arbitrarily rare patterns and select the most accurate one when two candidate patterns are incompatible, by configuring a granularity parameter. The analysis of the convergence of the two basic operators lays the foundation for analyzing other logical operators.

However, the performance of LDA depends on the consistency assumption of the global structure and the local structure. Some work extended LDA along this line of research and proposed local formulations of LDA. Unfortunately, the learning scheme of these algorithms is suboptimal in that the intrinsic relationship between data points is pre-learned in the original space, which is usually affected by the noise and redundant features. Besides, the time cost is relatively high. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a Fast Locality Discriminant Analysis framework (FLDA), which has three advantages: (1) It can divide a non-Gaussian distribution class into many sub-blocks that obey Gaussian distributions by using the anchor-based strategy. (2) It captures the manifold structure of data by learning the fuzzy membership relationship between data points and the corresponding anchor points, which can reduce computation time. (3) The weights between data points and anchor points are adaptively updated in the subspace where the irrelevant information and the noise in high-dimensional space have been effectively suppressed. Extensive experiments on toy data sets, UCI benchmark data sets and imbalanced data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "To design fast neural networks, many works have been focusing on reducing the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in FLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of re-duction in latency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and demonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the operators, especially the depthwise con-volution. We hence propose a novel partial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by cutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building upon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks, which attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of devices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-lk, our tiny FasterNet-TO is 2.8\u00d7, 3.3\u00d7, and 2.4\u00d7 faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate. Our large FasterNet-L achieves impressive 83.5% top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B, while having 36% higher inference throughput on GPU, as well as saving 37% compute time on CPU.

        "Abstract": "Attention-based neural networks, such as Transformers, have become ubiquitous in numerous applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. In all kinds of attention networks, the attention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input tokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning based on representations , wherein the attention maps of different layers are learned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the evolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual convolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the attention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a residual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token relationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an evolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it is beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this process. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced evolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various applications, including time-series representation, natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on time-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated Convolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best SOTA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly models the layer-wise evolution of attention maps.

While the performance of GPT-X architectures is there for all to see, many efforts are underway to penetrate the secrets of these black-boxes in terms of intelligent information processing whose output statistical distributions resemble that of natural language. In this work, through the complexity science framework, a comparative study of the stochastic processes underlying the texts produced by the English version of GPT-2 with respect to texts produced by human beings, notably novels in English and programming codes, is offered. The investigation, of a methodological nature, consists first of all of an analysis phase in which the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis \u2013 together with Zipf's law and approximate entropy \u2013 are adopted to characterize long-term correlations, regularities and recurrences in human and machine-produced texts. Results show several peculiarities and trends in terms of long-range correlations and recurrences in the last case. The synthesis phase, on the other hand, uses the complexity measures to build synthetic text descriptors \u2013 hence a suitable text embedding \u2013 which serve to constitute the features for feeding a machine learning system designed to operate feature selection through an evolutionary technique. Using multivariate analysis, it is then shown the grouping tendency of the three analyzed text types, allowing to place GTP-2 texts in between natural language texts and computer codes. Similarly, the classification task demonstrates that, given the high accuracy obtained in the automatic discrimination of text classes, the proposed set of complexity measures is highly informative. These interesting results allow us to add another piece to the theoretical understanding of the surprising results obtained by NLG systems based on deep learning and let us to improve the design of new informetrics or text mining systems for text classification, fake news detection, or even plagiarism detection.",

Traditional normal estimation wisdom heavily depends on priors such as surface shapes or noise distributions, while learning-based solutions settle for single types of hand-crafted features. Differently, our network is designed to refine the initial normal of each point by extracting additional information from multiple feature representations. To this end, several feature modules are developed and incorporated into Refine-Net by a novel connection module. Besides the overall network architecture of Refine-Net, we propose a new multi-scale fitting patch selection scheme for the initial normal estimation, by absorbing geometry domain knowledge. Also, Refine-Net is a generic normal estimation framework: 1) point normals obtained from other methods can be further refined, and 2) any feature module related to the surface geometric structures can be potentially integrated into the framework. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the clear superiority of Refine-Net over the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.",

In detail, for self-attention network (SAN) sponsored Transformer-based encoder, we introduce syntactic dependency of interest (SDOI) design into the SAN to form an SDOI-SAN with syntax-guided self-attention. Syntax-guided network (SG-Net) is then composed of this extra SDOI-SAN and the SAN from the original Transformer encoder through a dual contextual architecture for better linguistics inspired representation.

This survey summarizes both the theoretical progress and practical applications on IB over the past 20-plus years, where its basic theory, optimization, extensive models and task-oriented algorithms are systematically explored. Existing IB methods are roughly divided into two parts: traditional and deep IB, where the former contains the IBs optimized by traditional machine learning analysis techniques without involving any neural networks, and the latter includes the IBs involving the interpretation, optimization and improvement of deep neural works (DNNs). Specifically, based on the technique taxonomy, traditional IBs are further classified into three categories: Basic , Informative and Propagating IB ; While the deep IBs, based on the taxonomy of problem settings, contain Debate: Understanding DNNs with IB , Optimizing DNNs Using IB , and DNN-based IB methods.

It has been done well by the self-attention mechanism in the current state-of-the-art Transformer encoder, which has brought about significant improvements in the performance of many NLP tasks. Though the Transformer encoder may effectively capture general information in its resulting representations, the backbone information, meaning the gist of the input text, is not specifically focused on. In this paper, we propose explicit and implicit text compression approaches to enhance the Transformer encoding and evaluate models using this approach on several typical downstream tasks that rely on the encoding heavily. Our explicit text compression approaches use dedicated models to compress text, while our implicit text compression approach simply adds an additional module to the main model to handle text compression. We propose three ways of integration, namely backbone source-side fusion, target-side fusion, and both-side fusion, to integrate the backbone information into Transformer-based models for various downstream tasks. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed explicit and implicit text compression approaches improve results in comparison to strong baselines. We therefore conclude, when comparing the encodings to the baseline models, text compression helps the encoders to learn better language representations.",

We study the geometry of nonlinear embeddings in discriminant analysis with polynomial kernels and Gaussian kernel by identifying the population-level discriminant function that depends on the data distribution and the kernel. In order to obtain the discriminant function, we solve a generalized eigenvalue problem with between-class and within-class covariance operators. The polynomial discriminants are shown to capture the class difference through the population moments explicitly. For approximation of the Gaussian discriminant, we use a particular representation of the Gaussian kernel by utilizing the exponential generating function for Hermite polynomials. We also show that the Gaussian discriminant can be approximated using randomized projections of the data. Our results illuminate how the data distribution and the kernel interact in determination of the nonlinear embedding for discrimination, and provide a guideline for choice of the kernel and its parameters.",

Intuitively, it is more efficient to enhance/analyze the coded representations directly without decoding them into pixels. Therefore, we propose a versatile neural video coding (VNVC) framework, which targets learning compact representations to support both reconstruction and direct enhancement/analysis, thereby being versatile for both human and machine vision. Our VNVC framework has a feature-based compression loop. In the loop, one frame is encoded into compact representations and decoded to an intermediate feature that is obtained before performing reconstruction. The intermediate feature can be used as reference in motion compensation and motion estimation through feature-based temporal context mining and cross-domain motion encoder-decoder to compress the following frames. The intermediate feature is directly fed into video reconstruction, video enhancement, and video analysis networks to evaluate its effectiveness. The evaluation shows that our framework with the intermediate feature achieves high compression efficiency for video reconstruction and satisfactory task performances with lower complexities.",

        "Title": "A Generalized Method for Binary Optimization: Convergence Analysis and Applications",
        "Abstract": "Binary optimization problems (BOPs) arise naturally in many fields, such as information retrieval, computer vision, and machine learning. Most existing binary optimization methods either use continuous relaxation which can cause large quantization errors, or incorporate a highly specific algorithm that can only be used for particular loss functions. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel generalized optimization method, named Alternating Binary Matrix Optimization (ABMO), for solving BOPs. ABMO can handle BOPs with/without orthogonality or linear constraints for a large class of loss functions. ABMO involves rewriting the binary, orthogonality and linear constraints for BOPs as an intersection of two closed sets, then iteratively dividing the original problems into several small optimization problems that can be solved as closed forms. To provide a strict theoretical convergence analysis, we add a sufficiently small perturbation and translate the original problem to an approximated problem whose feasible set is continuous. We not only provide rigorous mathematical proof for the convergence to a stationary and feasible point, but also derive the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. The promising results obtained from four binary optimization tasks validate the superiority and the generality of ABMO compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Title": "Leveraging Symbolic Knowledge Bases for Commonsense Natural Language Inference Using Pattern Theory",
        "Abstract": "The commonsense natural language inference (CNLI) tasks aim to select the most likely follow-up statement to a contextual description of ordinary, everyday events and facts. Current approaches to transfer learning of CNLI models across tasks require many labeled data from the new task. This paper presents a way to reduce this need for additional annotated training data from the new task by leveraging symbolic knowledge bases, such as ConceptNet. We formulate a teacher-student framework for mixed symbolic-neural reasoning, with the large-scale symbolic knowledge base serving as the teacher and a trained CNLI model as the student. This hybrid distillation process involves two steps. The first step is a symbolic reasoning process. Given a collection of unlabeled data, we use an abductive reasoning framework based on Grenander's pattern theory to create weakly labeled data. Pattern theory is an energy-based graphical probabilistic framework for reasoning among random variables with varying dependency structures. In the second step, the weakly labeled data, along with a fraction of the labeled data, is used to transfer-learn the CNLI model into the new task. The goal is to reduce the fraction of labeled data required. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by using three publicly available datasets (OpenBookQA, SWAG, and HellaSWAG) and evaluating three CNLI models (BERT, LSTM, and ESIM) that represent different tasks. We show that, on average, we achieve 63% of the top performance of a fully supervised BERT model with no labeled data. With only 1,000 labeled samples, we can improve this performance to 72%. Interestingly, without training, the teacher mechanism itself has significant inference power. The pattern theory framework achieves 32.7% accuracy on OpenBookQA, outperforming transformer-based models such as GPT (26.6%), GPT-2 (30.2%), and BERT (27.1%) by a significant margin. We demonstrate that the framework can be generalized to successfully train neural CNLI models using knowledge distillation under unsupervised and semi-supervised learning settings. Our results show that it outperforms all unsupervised and weakly supervised baselines and some early supervised approaches, while offering competitive performance with fully supervised baselines. Additionally, we show that the abductive learning framework can be adapted for other downstream tasks, such as unsupervised semantic textual similarity, unsupervised sentiment classification, and zero-shot text classification, without significant modification to the framework. Finally, user studies show that the generated interpretations enhance its explainability by providing key insights into its reasoning mechanism.",

        "Title": "Brain-Machine Coupled Learning Method for Facial Emotion Recognition",
        "Abstract": "Neural network models of machine learning have shown promising prospects for visual tasks, such as facial emotion recognition (FER). However, the generalization of the model trained from a dataset with a few samples is limited. Unlike the machine, the human brain can effectively realize the required information from a few samples to complete the visual tasks. To learn the generalization ability of the brain, in this article, we propose a novel brain-machine coupled learning method for facial emotion recognition to let the neural network learn the visual knowledge of the machine and cognitive knowledge of the brain simultaneously. The proposed method utilizes visual images and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to couple training the models in the visual and cognitive domains. Each domain model consists of two types of interactive channels, common and private. Since the EEG signals can reflect brain activity, the cognitive process of the brain is decoded by a model following reverse engineering. Decoding the EEG signals induced by the facial emotion images, the common channel in the visual domain can approach the cognitive process in the cognitive domain. Moreover, the knowledge specific to each domain is found in each private channel using an adversarial strategy. After learning, without the participation of the EEG signals, only the concatenation of both channels in the visual domain is used to classify facial emotion images based on the visual knowledge of the machine and the cognitive knowledge learned from the brain. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can produce excellent performance on several public datasets. Further experiments show that the proposed method trained from the EEG signals has good generalization ability on new datasets and can be applied to other network models, illustrating the potential for practical applications.",

        "Title": "Regularized Optimal Transport Layers for Generalized Global Pooling Operations",
        "Abstract": "Global pooling is one of the most significant operations in many machine learning models and tasks, which works for information fusion and structured data (like sets and graphs) representation. However, without solid mathematical fundamentals, its practical implementations often depend on empirical mechanisms and thus lead to sub-optimal, even unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we develop a novel and generalized global pooling framework through the lens of optimal transport. The proposed framework is interpretable from the perspective of expectation-maximization. Essentially, it aims at learning an optimal transport across sample indices and feature dimensions, making the corresponding pooling operation maximize the conditional expectation of input data. We demonstrate that most existing pooling methods are equivalent to solving a regularized optimal transport (ROT) problem with different specializations, and more sophisticated pooling operations can be implemented by hierarchically solving multiple ROT problems. Making the parameters of the ROT problem learnable, we develop a family of regularized optimal transport pooling (ROTP) layers. We implement the ROTP layers as a new kind of deep implicit layer. Their model architectures correspond to different optimization algorithms. We test our ROTP layers in several representative set-level machine learning scenarios, including multi-instance learning (MIL), graph classification, graph set representation, and image classification. Experimental results show that applying our ROTP layers can reduce the difficulty of the design and selection of global pooling \u2014 our ROTP layers may either imitate some existing global pooling methods or lead to some new pooling layers fitting data better",

A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum variational autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relations and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further research directions for QGLMs.",

        "Abstract": "Data integration and cleaning have long been a key focus of the data management community. Recent research indicates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for such tasks. However, scaling and automating data wrangling with LLMs for real-world use cases poses additional challenges. Manual prompt engineering for example, is expensive and hard to operationalise, while full fine-tuning of LLMs incurs high compute and storage costs. Following up on previous work, we evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for efficiently automating data wrangling with LLMs. We conduct a study of four popular PEFT methods on differently sized LLMs for ten benchmark tasks, where we find that PEFT methods achieve performance on-par with full fine-tuning, and that we can leverage small LLMs with negligible performance loss. However, even though such PEFT methods are parameter-efficient, they still incur high compute costs at training time and require labeled training data. We explore a zero-shot setting to further reduce deployment costs, and propose our vision for ZEROMATCH, a novel approach to zero-shot entity matching. It is based on maintaining a large number of pretrained LLM variants from different domains and intelligently selecting an appropriate variant at inference time.",

        "Abstract": "Digital technologies are gaining widespread acceptance in engineering and offer opportunities for collating and curating knowledge during and beyond the life cycle of engineering products. Knowledge is central to strategy and operations in most engineering organizations and digital technologies have been employed in attempts to improve current knowledge management practices. A systematic literature review was undertaken to address the question: how do digital technologies influence knowledge management in the engineering sector? Twenty-seven primary studies were identified from 3097 papers on these topics within the engineering literature published between 2010 and 2022. Four knowledge management processes supported by digital technologies were recognized: knowledge creation, storage and retrieval, sharing and application. In supporting knowledge management, digital technologies were found to have been acting in five roles: repositories, transactive memory systems, communication spaces, boundary objects and non-human actors. However, the ability of digital technologies to perform these roles simultaneously had not been considered and similarly knowledge management had not been addressed as a holistic process. Hence, it was concluded that a holistic approach to knowledge management combined with the deployment of digital technologies in multiple roles simultaneously would likely yield significant competitive advantage and organizational value for organizations in the engineering sector.",

        "Title": "FLUID: Towards Efficient Continuous Transaction Processing in DAG-Based Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "In most blockchain-based application scenarios, a complete application logic consists of multiple continuous transactions, in which the initiation of one transaction depends on the confirmation result of the previous one. This mandates that continuous transactions must be processed in the correct order. Unfortunately, existing chain-based blockchains fail to effectively support continuous transaction processing due to considerable latency in confirming continuous transactions. Recent studies shifted from chain-based blockchains to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based blockchains, which reduced transaction confirmation latencies. However, DAG-based blockchains store transactions in an out-of-order manner that leads to unordered transaction processing. To address this challenge, we propose FLUID, a new DAG-based blockchain that supports continuous transaction processing while delivering high performance. The fundamental idea of FLUID is to design a transaction dependency tracking structure to ensure that continuous transactions can be processed in the correct order. FLUID utilizes a conflict resolution mechanism to provide instant confirmation and to support concurrent transaction processing with lower latencies. In addition, FLUID builds a checkpoint-based verification mechanism to achieve deterministic consensus on transaction processing results in the DAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed FLUID can improve the throughput over state-of-the-art OHIE by 66% with two orders of magnitude lower latencies.",

        "Abstract": "Embodied AI is one of the most popular studies in artificial intelligence and robotics, which can effectively improve the intelligence of real-world agents (i.e. robots) serving human beings. Scene knowledge is important for an agent to understand the surroundings and make correct decisions in the varied open world. Currently, knowledge base for embodied tasks is missing and most existing work use general knowledge base or pre-trained models to enhance the intelligence of an agent. For conventional knowledge base, it is sparse, insufficient in capacity and cost in data collection. For pre-trained models, they face the uncertainty of knowledge and hard maintenance. To overcome the challenges of scene knowledge, we propose a scene-driven multimodal knowledge graph (Scene-MMKG) construction method combining conventional knowledge engineering and large language models. A unified scene knowledge injection framework is introduced for knowledge representation. To evaluate the advantages of our proposed method, we instantiate Scene-MMKG considering typical indoor robotic functionalities ( Manip ulation and Mob ility), named ManipMob-MMKG . Comparisons in characteristics indicate our instantiated ManipMob-MMKG has broad superiority on data-collection efficiency and knowledge quality. Experimental results on typical embodied tasks show that knowledge-enhanced methods using our instantiated ManipMob-MMKG can improve the performance obviously without re-designing model structures complexly.",

Due to their powerful emergent abilities, recent LLMs are considered as a possible alternative to structured knowledge bases like knowledge graphs (KGs). However, while LLMs are proficient at learning probabilistic language patterns and engaging in conversations with humans, they, like previous smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), still have difficulty in recalling facts while generating knowledge-grounded contents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed enhancing data-driven PLMs with knowledge-based KGs to incorporate explicit factual knowledge into PLMs, thus improving their performance in generating texts requiring factual knowledge and providing more informed responses to user queries. This paper reviews the studies on enhancing PLMs with KGs, detailing existing knowledge graph enhanced pre-trained language models (KGPLMs) as well as their applications.

        "Abstract": "Flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs) have proved to be ideal devices that support embedded transaction protocols inside SSDs. Existing embedded transaction protocols in SSDs effectively improve transaction throughput, but still incur high transaction overhead and long recovery time. While it is reasonable to provide a small-capacity non-volatile (NVM-based) disk cache in the SSDs, in this paper, we propose a new embedded transaction protocol called Non-volatile Cache Transaction (NVCTX). NVCTX reduces transaction overhead and provides fast recovery by leveraging the small-capacity NVM-based disk cache from two aspects. First, we store transactional metadata, which is of small amount but is frequently accessed, in the NVM-based disk cache rather than in the flash memory. Second, we introduce two techniques, i.e., a dynamic allocation algorithm and a hybrid storing method, to improve the performance when the capacity of the NVM-based disk cache is very limited. We have implemented NVCTX on a real hardware board called Cosmos+ FPGA platform, and modified ext4 file system and NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) driver to be compatible with the transactional interfaces provided by NVCTX. For comparison, we also implement SCC, BPCC, WAL, and X-FTL protocols in the firmware of Cosmos+ FPGA platform. Evaluations using DBMS (Database Management System) and file system workloads show that, compared to four typical transaction protocols (SCC, BPCC, WAL, and X-FTL), NVCTX improves transaction throughput by up to 136.5, 9.4, 131.6 and 29.9 percent, reduces write traffic to flash memory by up to 42.8, 4.1, 62.4, 31.2 percent, lowers garbage collection overhead by up to 93.2, 63, 66.5, 22.1 percent, and shortens recovery time to 1/2574, 1/2559, 1/95 and 1/2 respectively compared with SCC, BPCC, WAL, and X-FTL",

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia, and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and, simultaneously, leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely: 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs , in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge.

        "Abstract": "Emerging cloud-native distributed databases rely on local NVMe SSDs to provide high-performance and highavailable data services to many cloud applications. However, the database clusters suffer from low utilization of local storage because of the imbalance between CPU and storage capacities within each node. For instance, the OceanBase distributed database cluster, with hundreds of PB local storage capacity, only utilizes around 40% of its local storage. Although disaggregated storage (EBS) can enhance storage utilization by provisioning the CPU and storage independently on demand, they suffer from performance bottlenecks and high costs. In this paper, we propose LightPool, a high-performance and lightweight storage pool architecture large-scale deployed in the OceanBase clusters, enhancing storage resource utilization. The key idea of LightPool is aggregating cluster storage into a storage pool and enabling unified management. In particular, LightPool adopts NVMe-oF to enable high-performance storage resource sharing among cluster nodes and integrate the storage pool with Kubernetes to achieve flexible management and allocation of storage resources. Furthermore, we design the hot-upgrade and hot-migration mechanisms to enhance the availability of LightPool. We have deployed LightPool on over 8500 nodes in production clusters. Statistics show that LightPool can improve storage resource utilization from about 40% to 65%. Experimental results show that the extra latency from LightPool is only about 2.1 \u03bcs compared to local storage. Compared to OpenEBS, LightPool enhances bandwidth up to 190.9% in microbenchmarks and throughput up to 6.9% in real-world applications. LightPool is the best practice to deploy NVMe-oF (NVMe/TCP) in the production environment. We also discuss important lessons and experiences learned from the development of LightPool.",

        "Abstract": "Bare-metal instances are crucial for high-value, mission-critical applications on the cloud. Tenants exclusively use these dedicated hardware resources. Local virtualized disks are essential for bare-metal instances to provide flexible and high-performance storage resources. Traditionally tenants can choose polling-based software virtualization techniques, but they consume too many valuable host CPU cores and suffer from performance degradation. Cloud vendors are hard to deploy existing hardware-assisted local storage solutions in bare-metal instances due to no access to the host OS to install customized drivers. Moreover, cloud vendors have difficulties managing and maintaining the local storage devices in bare-metal instances because hardware resources and host operating systems are completely utilized by tenants, then it will impact the availability of storage devices.This paper presents our design and experience with BM-Store, a novel high-performance hardware-assisted virtual local storage architecture for bare-metal clouds. BM-Store is transparent to the host that tenants are unaware of the underlying hardware architecture. Therefore, it can be deployed on a large scale in cloud vendors. BM-Store consists of two components: an FPGA-based BMS-Engine and an ARM-based BMS-Controller. The BMS-Engine accelerates the I/O path to enable high-performance virtual storage independent of disk devices without consuming any CPU resource on the host. The BMS-Controller is responsible for resource management and maintenance to achieve flexible and high available local storage. The results of the extensive experiments show that BM-Store can achieve near-native performance, which only introduces about 3 \u00b5s extra latency and average 4.0% throughput overhead to native disks. Compared to SPDK vhost, BM-Store achieves an average bandwidth improvement of 15.7% in microbenchmark and a maximum throughput enhancement of 13.4% in real-world applications.",

        "Abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently exploded in popularity thanks to their broad applicability to graph-related problems such as quantum chemistry, drug discovery, and high energy physics. However, meeting demand for novel GNN models and fast inference simultaneously is challenging due to the gap between developing efficient accelerators and the rapid creation of new GNN models. Prior art focuses on accelerating specific classes of GNNs, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), but lacks generality to support a wide range of existing or new GNN models. Furthermore, most works rely on graph pre-processing to exploit data locality, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic dataflow architecture for GNN acceleration, named FlowGNN, which is generalizable to the majority of message-passing GNNs. The contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a novel and scalable dataflow architecture, which generally supports a wide range of GNN models with message-passing mechanism. The architecture features a configurable dataflow optimized for simultaneous computation of node embedding, edge embedding, and message passing, which is generally applicable to all models. We also propose a rich library of model-specific components.

        "Abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference based on quantized narrow-precision integer data represents a promising research direction toward efficient deep learning computations on edge and mobile devices. On one side, recent progress of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) frameworks aimed at improving the accuracy of extremely quantized DNNs allows achieving results close to Floating-Point 32 (FP32), and provides high flexibility concerning the data sizes selection. Unfortunately, current Central Processing Unit (CPU) architectures and Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) targeting resource-constrained devices present limitations on the range of data sizes supported to compute DNN kernels.This paper presents Mix-GEMM, a hardware-software co-designed architecture capable of efficiently computing quantized DNN convolutional kernels based on byte and sub-byte data sizes. Mix-GEMM accelerates General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), representing the core kernel of DNNs, supporting all data size combinations from 8- to 2-bit, including mixed-precision computations, and featuring performance that scale with the decreasing of the computational data sizes. Our experimental evaluation, performed on representative quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), shows that a RISC-V based edge System-on-Chip (SoC) integrating Mix-GEMM achieves up to 1.3 TOPS/W in energy efficiency, and up to 13.6 GOPS in throughput, gaining from 5.3\u00d7 to 15.1\u00d7 in performance over the OpenBLAS GEMM frameworks running on a commercial RISC-V based edge processor. By performing synthesis and Place and Route (PnR) of the enhanced SoC in Global Foundries 22nm FDX technology, we show that Mix-GEMM only accounts for 1% of the overall area consumption.",

        "Abstract": "The proportion of machine learning (ML) inference in modern cloud workloads is rapidly increasing, and graphic processing units (GPUs) are the most preferred computational accelerators for it. The massively parallel computing capability of GPUs is well-suited to the inference workloads but consumes more power than conventional CPUs. Therefore, GPU servers contribute significantly to the total power consumption of a data center. However, despite their heavy power consumption, GPU power management in cloud-scale has not yet been actively researched. In this paper, we reveal three findings about energy efficiency of ML inference clusters in the cloud. \u2776 GPUs of different architectures have comparative advantages in energy efficiency to each other for a set of ML models. \u2777 The energy efficiency of a GPU set may significantly vary depending on the number of active GPUs and their clock frequencies even when producing the same level of throughput. \u2778 The service level objective(SLO)-blind dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) driver of commercial GPUs maintain an immoderately high clock frequency. Based on these implications, we propose a hierarchical GPU resource management approach for cloud-scale inference services. The proposed approach consists of energy-aware cluster allocation, intra-cluster node scaling, intra-node GPU scaling and GPU clock scaling schemes considering the inference service architecture hierarchy. We evaluated our approach with its prototype implementation and cloud-scale simulation. The evaluation with real-world traces showed that the proposed schemes can save up to 28.3% of the cloud-scale energy consumption when serving five ML models with 105 servers having three different kinds of GPUs.",

        "Abstract": "DNN workloads can be scheduled onto DNN accelerators in many different ways: from layer-by-layer scheduling to cross-layer depth-first scheduling (a.k.a. layer fusion, or cascaded execution). This results in a very broad scheduling space, with each schedule leading to varying hardware (HW) costs in terms of energy and latency. To rapidly explore this vast space for a wide variety of hardware architectures, analytical cost models are crucial to estimate scheduling effects on the HW level. However, state-of-the-art cost models are lacking support for exploring the complete depth-first scheduling space, for instance focusing only on activations while ignoring weights, or modeling only DRAM accesses while overlooking on-chip data movements. These limitations prevent researchers from systematically and accurately understanding the depth-first scheduling space.After formalizing this design space, this work proposes a unified modeling framework, DeFiNES, for layer-by-layer and depth-first scheduling to fill in the gaps. DeFiNES enables analytically estimating the hardware cost for possible schedules in terms of both energy and latency, while considering data access at every memory level. This is done for each schedule and HW architecture under study by optimally choosing the active part of the memory hierarchy per unique combination of operand, layer, and feature map tile. The hardware costs are estimated, taking into account both data computation and data copy phases. The analytical cost model is validated against measured data from a taped-out depth-first DNN accelerator, DepFiN, showing good modeling accuracy at the end-to-end neural network level. A comparison with generalized state-of-the-art demonstrates up to 10\u00d7 better solutions found with DeFiNES.",

        "Abstract": "The aggressive performance optimizations in modern microprocessors can result in security vulnerabilities. For example, timing-based attacks in processor caches can steal secret keys or break randomization. So far, finding cache-timing vulnerabilities is mostly performed by human experts, which is inefficient and laborious. There is a need for automatic tools that can explore vulnerabilities given that unreported vulnerabilities leave the systems at risk.In this paper, we propose AutoCAT, an automated exploration framework that finds cache timing-channel attack sequences using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AutoCAT formulates the cache timing-channel attack as a guessing game between an attack program and a victim program holding a secret. This guessing game can thus be solved via modern deep RL techniques. AutoCAT can explore attacks in various cache configurations without knowing design details and under different attack and victim program configurations. AutoCAT can also find attacks to bypass certain detection and defense mechanisms. In particular, AutoCAT discovered StealthyStreamline, a new attack that is able to bypass performance counter-based detection and has up to a 71% higher information leakage rate than the state-of-the-art LRU-based attacks on real processors. AutoCAT is the first of its kind in using RL for crafting microarchitectural timing-channel attack sequences and can accelerate cache timing-channel exploration for secure microprocessor designs.",

        "Abstract": "Securing deep neural networks (DNNs) is a problem of significant interest since an ML model incorporates high-quality intellectual property, features of data sets painstakingly collated by mechanical turks, and novel methods of training on large cluster computers. Sadly, attacks to extract model parameters are on the rise, and thus designers are being forced to create architectures for securing such models. State-of-the-art proposals in this field take the deterministic memory access patterns of such networks into cognizance (albeit partially), group a set of memory blocks into a tile, and maintain state at the level of tiles (to reduce storage space). For providing integrity guarantees (tamper avoidance), they don\u2019t propose any significant optimizations, and still maintain block-level state.We observe that it is possible to exploit the deterministic memory access patterns of DNNs even further, and maintain state information for only the current tile and current layer, which may comprise a large number of tiles. This reduces the storage space, reduces the number of memory accesses, increases performance, and simplifies the design without sacrificing any security guarantees. The key techniques in our proposed accelerator architecture, Securator, are to encode memory access patterns to create a small HW-based tile version number generator for a given layer, and to store layer-level MACs. We completely eliminate the need for having a MAC cache and a tile version number store (as used in related work). We show that using intelligently-designed mathematical operations, these structures are not required. By reducing such overheads, we show a speedup of 20.56% over the closest competing work.",

        "Abstract": "While vision transformers (ViTs) have continuously achieved new milestones in the field of computer vision, their sophisticated network architectures with high computation and memory costs have impeded their deployment on resource-limited edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hardware-efficient image-adaptive token pruning framework called HeatViT for efficient yet accurate ViT acceleration on embedded FPGAs. Based on the inherent computational patterns in ViTs, we first adopt an effective, hardware-efficient, and learnable head-evaluation token selector, which can be progressively inserted before transformer blocks to dynamically identify and consolidate the non-informative tokens from input images. Moreover, we implement the token selector on hardware by adding miniature control logic to heavily reuse existing hardware components built for the backbone ViT. To improve the hardware efficiency, we further employ 8-bit fixed-point quantization and propose polynomial approximations with regularization effect on quantization error for the frequently used nonlinear functions in ViTs. Compared to existing ViT pruning studies, under the similar computation cost, HeatViT can achieve 0.7% ~ 8.9% higher accuracy; while under the similar model accuracy, HeatViT can achieve more than 28.4% ~ 65.3% computation reduction, for various widely used ViTs, including DeiT-T, DeiT-S, DeiT-B, LV-ViT-S, and LV-ViT-M, on the ImageNet dataset.

In recent years, convolutional neural network-based methods have dominated image dehazing. However, vision Transformers, which has recently made a breakthrough in high-level vision tasks, has not brought new dimensions to image dehazing. We start with the popular Swin Transformer and find that several of its key designs are unsuitable for image dehazing. To this end, we propose DehazeFormer, which consists of various improvements, such as the modified normalization layer, activation function, and spatial information aggregation scheme. We train multiple variants of DehazeFormer on various datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. Specifically, on the most frequently used SOTS indoor set, our small model outperforms FFA-Net with only 25% #Param and 5% computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, our large model is the first method with the PSNR over 40 dB on the SOTS indoor set, dramatically outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods.

However, CNN has been facing the problem of small samples and GNN has to pay a huge computational cost, which restrict the performance of the two models. In this paper, we propose Weighted Feature Fusion of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Attention Network (WFCG) for HSI classification, by using the characteristics of superpixel-based GAT and pixel-based CNN, which proved to be complementary. We first establish GAT with the help of superpixel-based encoder and decoder modules. Then we combined the attention mechanism to construct CNN. Finally, the features are weighted fusion with the characteristics of two neural network models.

The former extracts multiscale point-wise descriptive features, while the latter captures rich feature details with hierarchical residuals. To generate neat edges, our discriminator uses a graph filter to extract and retain high frequency points. The generated high resolution point cloud and corresponding high frequency points help the discriminator learn the global and high frequency properties of the point cloud. We also propose an identity distribution loss function to make sure that the upsampled points remain on the underlying surface of the input low resolution point cloud. To assess the regularity of the upsampled points in high frequency regions, we introduce two evaluation metrics.

Although several COD methods have been developed, they still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the intrinsic similarities between the foreground objects and background surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation and Propagation Network (FAP-Net) for camouflaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Guidance Module (BGM) to explicitly model the boundary characteristic, which can provide boundary-enhanced features to boost the COD performance. To capture the scale variations of the camouflaged objects, we propose a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) to characterize the multi-scale information from each layer and obtain the aggregated feature representations. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-level Fusion and Propagation Module (CFPM). In the CFPM, the feature fusion part can effectively integrate the features from adjacent layers to exploit the cross-level correlations, and the feature propagation part can transmit valuable context information from the encoder to the decoder network via a gate unit. Finally, we formulate a unified and end-to-end trainable framework where cross-level features can be effectively fused and propagated for capturing rich context information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark camouflaged datasets demonstrate that our FAP-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art COD models. Moreover, our model can be extended to the polyp segmentation task, and the comparison results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting polyps.

Existing underwater image enhancement algorithms focus on the restoration of contrast and scene reflection. In practice, the enhanced images may not benefit the effectiveness of detection and even lead to a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an object-guided twin adversarial contrastive learning based underwater enhancement method to achieve both visual-friendly and task-orientated enhancement. Concretely, we first develop a bilateral constrained closed-loop adversarial enhancement module, which eases the requirement of paired data with the unsupervised manner and preserves more informative features by coupling with the twin inverse mapping. In addition, to confer the restored images with a more realistic appearance, we also adopt the contrastive cues in the training phase. To narrow the gap between visually-oriented and detection-favorable target images, a task-aware feedback module is embedded in the enhancement process, where the coherent gradient information of the detector is incorporated to guide the enhancement towards the detection-pleasing direction. To validate the performance, we allocate a series of prolific detectors into our framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the enhanced results of our method show remarkable amelioration in visual quality, the accuracy of different detectors conducted on our enhanced images has been promoted notably.

Given the ability to exploit long-term dependencies, transformers are promising to help atypical convolutional neural networks to learn more contextualized visual representations. However, most of recently proposed transformer-based segmentation approaches simply treated transformers as assisted modules to help encode global context into convolutional representations. To address this issue, we introduce nnFormer (i.e., not-another transFormer), a 3D transformer for volumetric medical image segmentation. nnFormer not only exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and self-attention operations, but also introduces local and global volume-based self-attention mechanism to learn volume representations. Moreover, nnFormer proposes to use skip attention to replace the traditional concatenation/summation operations in skip connections in U-Net like architecture. Experiments show that nnFormer significantly outperforms previous transformer-based counterparts by large margins on three public datasets. Compared to nnUNet, the most widely recognized convnet-based 3D medical segmentation model, nnFormer produces significantly lower HD95 and is much more computationally efficient. Furthermore, we show that nnFormer and nnUNet are highly complementary to each other in model ensembling. Codes and models of nnFormer are available at https://git.io/JSf3i .",

Current classification methods have limitations in heterogeneous feature representation and information fusion of multi-modality remote sensing data (e.g., hyperspectral and LiDAR data), these shortcomings restrict the collaborative classification accuracy of remote sensing data. The proposed deep hierarchical vision transformer architecture utilizes both the powerful modeling capability of long-range dependencies and strong generalization ability across different domains of the transformer network, which is based exclusively on the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, the spectral sequence transformer is exploited to handle the long-range dependencies along the spectral dimension from hyperspectral images, because all diagnostic spectral bands contribute to the land cover classification. Thereafter, we utilize the spatial hierarchical transformer structure to extract hierarchical spatial features from hyperspectral and LiDAR data, which are also crucial for classification. Furthermore, the cross attention (CA) feature fusion pattern could adaptively and dynamically fuse heterogeneous features from multi-modality data, and this contextual aware fusion mode further improves the collaborative classification performance. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted on three benchmark hyperspectral and LiDAR datasets, and the DHViT model could yield an average overall classification accuracy of 99.58%, 99.55%, and 96.40% on three datasets, respectively, which sufficiently certify the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method.",

Some existing deep learning based methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the depth or width of convolution. The learning ability of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a Detail-Enhanced Attention Block (DEAB) consisting of Detail-Enhanced Convolution (DEConv) and Content-Guided Attention (CGA) is proposed to boost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance. Specifically, the DEConv contains difference convolutions which can integrate prior information to complement the vanilla one and enhance the representation capacity. Then by using the re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a vanilla convolution to reduce parameters and computational cost. By assigning the unique Spatial Importance Map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend more useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup fusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the gradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our Detail-Enhanced Attention Network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality haze-free images.

However, when the face image is suffering from large poses, heavy occlusions and complicated illuminations, they cannot learn discriminative feature representations and effective facial shape constraints, nor can they accurately predict the value of each element in the landmark heatmap, limiting their detection accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel Reference Heatmap Transformer (RHT) by introducing reference heatmap information for more precise facial landmark detection. The proposed RHT consists of a Soft Transformation Module (STM) and a Hard Transformation Module (HTM), which can cooperate with each other to encourage the accurate transformation of the reference heatmap information and facial shape constraints. Then, a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module (MSFFM) is proposed to fuse the transformed heatmap features and the semantic features learned from the original face images to enhance feature representations for producing more accurate target heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to enhance facial landmark detection by transforming the reference heatmap information. The experimental results from challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.",

First, we develop a feature reference module with lateral connections to adaptively extract bottom-up features with richer details for feature pyramid construction. Second, we design a feature calibration module between adjacent layers that calibrates the upsampled features to be spatially aligned, allowing for feature fusion with accurate correspondences. Third, we introduce a feature feedback module in FPN, which creates a communication channel from the feature pyramid back to the bottom-up backbone and doubles the encoding capacity, enabling the entire architecture to generate incrementally more powerful representations. The TFPN is extensively evaluated over four popular dense prediction tasks, i.e., object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate that TFPN consistently and significantly outperforms the vanilla FPN. Our code is available at https://github.com/jamesliang819 .",

        "Abstract": "The task of point cloud upsampling aims to acquire dense and uniform point sets from sparse and irregular point sets. Although significant progress has been made with deep learning models, state-of-the-art methods require ground-truth dense point sets as the supervision, which makes them limited to be trained under synthetic paired training data and not suitable to be under real-scanned sparse data. However, it is expensive and tedious to obtain large numbers of paired sparse-dense point sets as supervision from real-scanned sparse data. To address this problem, we propose a self-supervised point cloud upsampling network, named SPU-Net, to capture the inherent upsampling patterns of points lying on the underlying object surface. Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework, which contains two main components: point feature extraction and point feature expansion, respectively. In the point feature extraction, we integrate the self-attention module with the graph convolution network (GCN) to capture context information inside and among local regions simultaneously. In the point feature expansion, we introduce a hierarchically learnable folding strategy to generate upsampled point sets with learnable 2D grids. Moreover, to further optimize the noisy points in the generated point sets, we propose a novel self-projection optimization associated with uniform and reconstruction terms as a joint loss to facilitate the self-supervised point cloud upsampling. We conduct various experiments on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets, and the results demonstrate that we achieve comparable performances to state-of-the-art supervised methods.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-view clustering aims at simultaneously obtaining a consensus underlying subspace across multiple views and conducting clustering on the learned consensus subspace, which has gained a variety of interest in image processing. In this paper, we propose the Semi-supervised Structured Subspace Learning algorithm for clustering data points from Multiple sources (SSSL-M). We explicitly extend the traditional multi-view clustering with a semi-supervised manner and then build an anti-block-diagonal indicator matrix with small amount of supervisory information to pursue the block-diagonal structure of the shared affinity matrix. SSSL-M regularizes multiple view-specific affinity matrices into a shared affinity matrix based on reconstruction through a unified framework consisting of backward encoding networks and the self-expressive mapping. The shared affinity matrix is comprehensive and can flexibly encode complementary information from multiple view-specific affinity matrices. An enhanced structural consistency of affinity matrices from different views can be achieved and the intrinsic relationships among affinity matrices from multiple views can be effectively reflected in this manner. Technically, we formulate the proposed model as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an alternating optimization scheme. Experimental results over seven different benchmark datasets demonstrate that better clustering results can be obtained by our method compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Title": "Deep Bilateral Filtering Network for Point-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images",
        "Abstract": "Semantic segmentation methods based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in recent years. However, training such deep neural networks relies heavily on a large number of images with accurate pixel-level labels, which requires a huge amount of human effort, especially for large-scale remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a point-based weakly supervised learning framework called the deep bilateral filtering network (DBFNet) for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Compared with pixel-level labels, point annotations are usually sparse and cannot reveal the complete structure of the objects; they also lack boundary information, thus resulting in incomplete prediction within the object and the loss of object boundaries. To address these problems, we incorporate the bilateral filtering technique into deeply learned representations in two respects. First, since a target object contains smooth regions that always belong to the same category, we perform deep bilateral filtering (DBF) to filter the deep features by a nonlinear combination of nearby feature values, which encourages the nearby and similar features to become closer, thus achieving a consistent prediction in the smooth region. In addition, the DBF can distinguish the boundary by enlarging the distance between the features on different sides of the edge, thus preserving the boundary information well. Experimental results on two widely used datasets, the ISPRS 2-D semantic labeling Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, demonstrate that our proposed DBFNet can achieve a highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods.

However, CNN has been facing the problem of small samples and GNN has to pay a huge computational cost, which restrict the performance of the two models. In this paper, we propose Weighted Feature Fusion of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Attention Network (WFCG) for HSI classification, by using the characteristics of superpixel-based GAT and pixel-based CNN, which proved to be complementary. We first establish GAT with the help of superpixel-based encoder and decoder modules. Then we combined the attention mechanism to construct CNN. Finally, the features are weighted fusion with the characteristics of two neural network models. Rigorous experiments on three real-world HSI data sets show WFCG can fully explore the high-dimensional feature of HSI, and obtain competitive results compared to other state-of-the art methods.",

        "Abstract": "Owing to the limitations of imaging sensors, it is challenging to obtain a medical image that simultaneously contains functional metabolic information and structural tissue details. Multimodal medical image fusion, an effective way to merge the complementary information in different modalities, has become a significant technique to facilitate clinical diagnosis and surgical navigation. With powerful feature representation ability, deep learning (DL)-based methods have improved such fusion results but still have not achieved satisfactory performance. Specifically, existing DL-based methods generally depend on convolutional operations, which can well extract local patterns but have limited capability in preserving global context information. To compensate for this defect and achieve accurate fusion, we propose a novel unsupervised method to fuse multimodal medical images via a multiscale adaptive Transformer termed MATR. In the proposed method, instead of directly employing vanilla convolution, we introduce an adaptive convolution for adaptively modulating the convolutional kernel based on the global complementary context. To further model long-range dependencies, an adaptive Transformer is employed to enhance the global semantic extraction capability. Our network architecture is designed in a multiscale fashion so that useful multimodal information can be adequately acquired from the perspective of different scales. Moreover, an objective function composed of a structural loss and a region mutual information loss is devised to construct constraints for information preservation at both the structural-level and the feature-level. Extensive experiments on a mainstream database demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other representative and state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative evaluation. We also extend the proposed method to address other biomedical image fusion issues, and the pleasing fusion results illustrate that MATR has good generalization capability.

        "Title": "Interpretable Multi-Modal Image Registration Network Based on Disentangled Convolutional Sparse Coding",
        "Abstract": "Multi-modal image registration aims to spatially align two images from different modalities to make their feature points match with each other. Captured by different sensors, the images from different modalities often contain many distinct features, which makes it challenging to find their accurate correspondences. With the success of deep learning, many deep networks have been proposed to align multi-modal images, however, they are mostly lack of interpretability. In this paper, we first model the multi-modal image registration problem as a disentangled convolutional sparse coding (DCSC) model. In this model, the multi-modal features that are responsible for alignment (RA features) are well separated from the features that are not responsible for alignment (nRA features). By only allowing the RA features to participate in the deformation field prediction, we can eliminate the interference of the nRA features to improve the registration accuracy and efficiency. The optimization process of the DCSC model to separate the RA and nRA features is then turned into a deep network, namely Interpretable Multi-modal Image Registration Network (InMIR-Net). To ensure the accurate separation of RA and nRA features, we further design an accompanying guidance network (AG-Net) to supervise the extraction of RA features in InMIR-Net. The advantage of InMIR-Net is that it provides a universal framework to tackle both rigid and non-rigid multi-modal image registration tasks. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method on both rigid and non-rigid registrations on various multi-modal image datasets, including RGB/depth images, RGB/near-infrared (NIR) images, RGB/multi-spectral images, T1/T2 weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and computed tomography (CT)/MR images.

Model-based image denoising approaches can achieve good generalization ability over different noise levels and are with high interpretability. Learning-based approaches are able to achieve better results, but usually with weaker generalization ability and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-inspired invertible network (WINNet) to combine the merits of the wavelet-based approaches and learning-based approaches. The proposed WINNet consists of $K$ -scale of lifting inspired invertible neural networks (LINNs) and sparsity-driven denoising networks together with a noise estimation network. The network architecture of LINNs is inspired by the lifting scheme in wavelets. LINNs are used to learn a non-linear redundant transform with perfect reconstruction property to facilitate noise removal. The denoising network implements a sparse coding process for denoising. The noise estimation network estimates the noise level from the input image which will be used to adaptively adjust the soft-thresholds in LINNs. The forward transform of LINNs produces a redundant multi-scale representation for denoising. The denoised image is reconstructed using the inverse transform of LINNs with the denoised detail channels and the original coarse channel. The simulation results show that the proposed WINNet method is highly interpretable and has strong generalization ability to unseen noise levels. It also achieves competitive results in the non-blind/blind image denoising and in image deblurring.",

        "Abstract": "At present, deep neural networks are at risk from backdoor attacks, but natural language processing (NLP) lacks sufficient research on backdoor attacks. To improve the invisibility of backdoor attacks, some innovative textual backdoor attack methods utilize modern language models to generate poisoned text with backdoor triggers, which are called feature space backdoor attacks. However, this article find that texts generated by the same language model without backdoor triggers also have a high probability of activating the backdoors they injected. Therefore, this article proposes a multistyle transfer-based backdoor attack that uses multiple text styles as the backdoor trigger. Furthermore, inspired by the ability of modern language models to distinguish between texts generated by different language models, this article proposes a paraphrase-based backdoor attack, which leverages the shared characteristics of sentences generated by the same paraphrase model as the backdoor trigger. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that both backdoor attack methods can be effective against NLP models. More importantly, compared with other feature space backdoor attacks, the poisoned samples generated by paraphrase-based backdoor attacks have improved semantic similarity.",

        "Abstract": "Learning-based infrared small object detection methods currently rely heavily on the classification backbone network. This tends to result in tiny object loss and feature distinguishability limitations as the network depth increases. Furthermore, small objects in infrared images are frequently emerged bright and dark, posing severe demands for obtaining precise object contrast information. For this reason, we in this paper propose a simple and effective “U-Net in U-Net” framework, UIU-Net for short, and detect small objects in infrared images. As the name suggests, UIU-Net embeds a tiny U-Net into a larger U-Net backbone, enabling the multi-level and multi-scale representation learning of objects. Moreover, UIU-Net can be trained from scratch, and the learned features can enhance global and local contrast information effectively. More specifically, the UIU-Net model is divided into two modules: the resolution-maintenance deep supervision (RM-DS) module and the interactive-cross attention (IC-A) module. RM-DS integrates Residual U-blocks into a deep supervision network to generate deep multi-scale resolution-maintenance features while learning global context information. Further, IC-A encodes the local context information between the low-level details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments conducted on two infrared single-frame image datasets, i.e., SIRST and Synthetic datasets, show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UIU-Net in comparison with several state-of-the-art infrared small object detection methods. The proposed UIU-Net also produces powerful generalization performance for video sequence infrared small object datasets, e.g., ATR ground/air video sequence dataset.

        "Abstract": "Underwater images typically suffer from color deviations and low visibility due to the wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. To deal with these degradation issues, we propose an efficient and robust underwater image enhancement method, called MLLE. Specifically, we first locally adjust the color and details of an input image according to a minimum color loss principle and a maximum attenuation map-guided fusion strategy. Afterward, we employ the integral and squared integral maps to compute the mean and variance of local image blocks, which are used to adaptively adjust the contrast of the input image. Meanwhile, a color balance strategy is introduced to balance the color differences between channel a and channel b in the CIELAB color space. Our enhanced results are characterized by vivid color, improved contrast, and enhanced details. Extensive experiments on three underwater image enhancement datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also appealing in its fast processing speed within 1s for processing an image of size 1024×1024×3 on a single CPU. Experiments further suggest that our method can effectively improve the performance of underwater image segmentation, keypoint detection, and saliency detection.

        "Abstract": "Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small targets from clutter backgrounds. With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be directly applied to infrared small targets since pooling layers in their networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNA-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the repetitive interaction in DNIM, the information of infrared small targets in deep layers can be maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our DNA-Net, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and fully exploited by repetitive fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of probability of detection ( ${P}_{d}$ ), false-alarm rate ( ${F}_{a}$ ), and intersection of union ( $IoU$ ).",

        "Abstract": "Multi-view subspace clustering has attracted intensive attention to effectively fuse multi-view information by exploring appropriate graph structures. Although existing works have made impressive progress in clustering performance, most of them suffer from the cubic time complexity which could prevent them from being efficiently applied into large-scale applications. To improve the efficiency, anchor sampling mechanism has been proposed to select vital landmarks to represent the whole data. However, existing anchor selecting usually follows the heuristic sampling strategy, e.g. $k$ -means or uniform sampling. As a result, the procedures of anchor selecting and subsequent subspace graph construction are separated from each other which may adversely affect clustering performance. Moreover, the involved hyper-parameters further limit the application of traditional algorithms. To address these issues, we propose a novel subspace clustering method termed Fast Parameter-free Multi-view Subspace Clustering with Consensus Anchor Guidance (FPMVS-CAG). Firstly, we jointly conduct anchor selection and subspace graph construction into a unified optimization formulation. By this way, the two processes can be negotiated with each other to promote clustering quality. Moreover, our proposed FPMVS-CAG is proved to have linear time complexity with respect to the sample number. In addition, FPMVS-CAG can automatically learn an optimal anchor subspace graph without any extra hyper-parameters. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method against the existing state-of-the-art multi-view subspace clustering competitors. These merits make FPMVS-CAG more suitable for large-scale subspace clustering. The code of FPMVS-CAG is publicly available at https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/FPMVS-CAG .",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a well established paradigm for compressing deep neural networks. The typical way of conducting knowledge distillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the teacher network to harness the knowledge at one or multiple spots ( i.e. , layers) in the teacher network. The distillation spots, once specified, will not change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation process. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to training samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation strategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the distillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training iteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on “where to distill” instead of “what to distill” that is widely investigated by most existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art distillers are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of SAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation settings.

However, the inherent differences and relations between detection and re-identification (ReID) are unconsciously overlooked because of treating them as two isolated tasks in the one-shot tracking paradigm. This leads to inferior performance compared with existing two-stage methods. In this paper, we first dissect the reasoning process for these two tasks, which reveals that the competition between them inevitably would destroy task-dependent representations learning. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel reciprocal network (REN) with a self-relation and cross-relation design so that to impel each branch to better learn task-dependent representations. The proposed model aims to alleviate the deleterious tasks competition, meanwhile improve the cooperation between detection and ReID. Furthermore, we introduce a scale-aware attention network (SAAN) that prevents semantic level misalignment to improve the association capability of ID embeddings. By integrating the two delicately designed networks into a one-shot online MOT system, we construct a strong MOT tracker, namely CSTrack.

        "Abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification refers to identifying land-cover categories of pixels based on spectral signatures and spatial information of HSIs. In recent deep learning-based methods, to explore the spatial information of HSIs, the HSI patch is usually cropped from original HSI as the input. And $3 \times 3$ convolution is utilized as a key component to capture spatial features for HSI classification. However, the $3 \times 3$ convolution is sensitive to the spatial rotation of inputs, which results in that recent methods perform worse in rotated HSIs. To alleviate this problem, a rotation-invariant attention network (RIAN) is proposed for HSI classification. First, a center spectral attention (CSpeA) module is designed to avoid the influence of other categories of pixels to suppress redundant spectral bands. Then, a rectified spatial attention (RSpaA) module is proposed to replace $3 \times 3$ convolution for extracting rotation-invariant spectral-spatial features from HSI patches. The CSpeA module, the $1 \times 1$ convolution and the RSpaA module are utilized to build the proposed RIAN for HSI classification. Experimental results demonstrate that RIAN is invariant to the spatial rotation of HSIs and has superior performance, e.g., achieving an overall accuracy of 86.53% (1.04% improvement) on the Houston database.

The first layer of switching regulation is the Markov chain to characterize the switching stochastic properties of the systems suffering from random component failures and sudden environmental disturbances. Meanwhile, PDTSR, as the second-layer switching regulation, is used to depict the variations in the transition probability of the aforementioned Markov chain. For systems under double-layer switching regulation, the purpose of the addressed issue is to design a mode-dependent synchronization controller for the network with the desired controller gains calculated by solving convex optimization problems. As such, new sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the synchronization error systems are mean-square exponentially stable with a specified level of the $H$ performance.

PruneFL includes initial pruning at a selected client and further pruning as part of the FL process. The model size is adapted during this process, which includes maximizing the approximate empirical risk reduction divided by the time of one FL round. Our experiments with various datasets on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) show that: 1) we significantly reduce the training time compared to conventional FL and various other pruning-based methods and 2) the pruned model with automatically determined size converges to an accuracy that is very similar to the original model, and it is also a lottery ticket of the original model.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, the problem of tracking control for a class of nonlinear time-varying full state constrained systems is investigated. By constructing the time-varying asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and combining it with the backstepping algorithm, the intelligent controller and adaptive law are developed. Neural networks (NNs) are utilized to approximate the uncertain function. It is well known that in the past research of nonlinear systems with state constraints, the state constraint boundary is either a constant or a time-varying function. In this article, the constraint boundaries both related to state and time are investigated, which makes the design of control algorithm more complex and difficult. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the time-varying full state constraints are not violated. In the end, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is verified by numerical simulation.",

    {   "Title": "A Review of Single-Source Deep Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation",
        "Abstract": "Large-scale labeled training datasets have enabled deep neural networks to excel across a wide range of benchmark vision tasks. However, in many applications, it is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled or unlabeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to the presence of domain shift or dataset bias . Domain adaptation (DA) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this article, we review the latest single-source deep unsupervised DA methods focused on visual tasks and discuss new perspectives for future research. We begin with the definitions of different DA strategies and the descriptions of existing benchmark datasets. We then summarize and compare different categories of single-source unsupervised DA methods, including discrepancy-based methods, adversarial discriminative methods, adversarial generative methods, and self-supervision-based methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions with challenges and possible solutions.",

    {   "Title": "Graph Information Aggregation Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification",
        "Abstract": "Most domain adaptation (DA) methods in cross-scene hyperspectral image classification focus on cases where source data (SD) and target data (TD) with the same classes are obtained by the same sensor. However, the classification performance is significantly reduced when there are new classes in TD. In addition, domain alignment, as one of the main approaches in DA, is carried out based on local spatial information, rarely taking into account nonlocal spatial information (nonlocal relationships) with strong correspondence. A graph information aggregation cross-domain few-shot learning (Gia-CFSL) framework is proposed, intending to make up for the above-mentioned shortcomings by combining FSL with domain alignment based on graph information aggregation. SD with all label samples and TD with a few label samples are implemented for FSL episodic training. Meanwhile, intradomain distribution extraction block (IDE-block) and cross-domain similarity aware block (CSA-block) are designed. The IDE-block is used to characterize and aggregate the intradomain nonlocal relationships and the interdomain feature and distribution similarities are captured in the CSA-block. Furthermore, feature-level and distribution-level cross-domain graph alignments are used to mitigate the impact of domain shift on FSL. Experimental results on three public HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The codes will be available from the website: https://github.com/YuxiangZhang-BIT/IEEE_TNNLS_Gia-CFSL .",

    {   "Title": "A Continual Learning Survey: Defying Forgetting in Classification Tasks",
        "Abstract": "Artificial neural networks thrive in solving the classification problem for a particular rigid task, acquiring knowledge through generalized learning behaviour from a distinct training phase. The resulting network resembles a static entity of knowledge, with endeavours to extend this knowledge without targeting the original task resulting in a catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern: (1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art; (2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner; (3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods; and (4) baselines. We empirically scrutinize method strengths and weaknesses on three benchmarks, considering Tiny Imagenet and large-scale unbalanced iNaturalist and a sequence of recognition datasets. We study the influence of model capacity, weight decay and dropout regularization, and the order in which the tasks are presented, and qualitatively compare methods in terms of required memory, computation time, and storage.",

    {   "Title": "Image Quality Assessment: Unifying Structure and Texture Similarity",
        "Abstract": "Objective measures of image quality generally operate by comparing pixels of a “degraded” image to those of the original. Relative to human observers, these measures are overly sensitive to resampling of texture regions (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). Here, we develop the first full-reference image quality model with explicit tolerance to texture resampling. Using a convolutional neural network, we construct an injective and differentiable function that transforms images to multi-scale overcomplete representations. We demonstrate empirically that the spatial averages of the feature maps in this representation capture texture appearance, in that they provide a set of sufficient statistical constraints to synthesize a wide variety of texture patterns. We then describe an image quality method that combines correlations of these spatial averages (“texture similarity”) with correlations of the feature maps (“structure similarity”). The parameters of the proposed measure are jointly optimized to match human ratings of image quality, while minimizing the reported distances between subimages cropped from the same texture images. Experiments show that the optimized method explains human perceptual scores, both on conventional image quality databases, as well as on texture databases. The measure also offers competitive performance on related tasks such as texture classification and retrieval. Finally, we show that our method is relatively insensitive to geometric transformations (e.g., translation and dilation), without use of any specialized training or data augmentation.

    {   "Title": "Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement",
        "Abstract": "We present SR3, an approach to image Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement. SR3 adapts denoising diffusion probabilistic models (Ho et al. 2020), (Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015) to image-to-image translation, and performs super-resolution through a stochastic iterative denoising process. Output images are initialized with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refined using a U-Net architecture that is trained on denoising at various noise levels, conditioned on a low-resolution input image. SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation on a standard 8× face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ for which SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic outputs, while GAN baselines do not exceed a fool rate of 34%. We evaluate SR3 on a 4× super-resolution task on ImageNet, where SR3 outperforms baselines in human evaluation and classification accuracy of a ResNet-50 classifier trained on high-resolution images. We further show the effectiveness of SR3 in cascaded image generation, where a generative model is chained with super-resolution models to synthesize high-resolution images with competitive FID scores on the class-conditional 256×256 ImageNet generation challenge.",

    {   "Title": "Plug-and-Play Image Restoration With Deep Denoiser Prior",
        "Abstract": "Recent works on plug-and-play image restoration have shown that a denoiser can implicitly serve as the image prior for model-based methods to solve many inverse problems. Such a property induces considerable advantages for plug-and-play image restoration (e.g., integrating the flexibility of model-based method and effectiveness of learning-based methods) when the denoiser is discriminatively learned via deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with large modeling capacity. However, while deeper and larger CNN models are rapidly gaining popularity, existing plug-and-play image restoration hinders its performance due to the lack of suitable denoiser prior. In order to push the limits of plug-and-play image restoration, we set up a benchmark deep denoiser prior by training a highly flexible and effective CNN denoiser. We then plug the deep denoiser prior as a modular part into a half quadratic splitting based iterative algorithm to solve various image restoration problems. We, meanwhile, provide a thorough analysis of parameter setting, intermediate results and empirical convergence to better understand the working mechanism. Experimental results on three representative image restoration tasks, including deblurring, super-resolution and demosaicing, demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play image restoration with deep denoiser prior not only significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art model-based methods but also achieves competitive or even superior performance against state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

        "Abstract": "As an essential problem in computer vision, salient object detection (SOD) has attracted an increasing amount of research attention over the years. Recent advances in SOD are predominantly led by deep learning-based solutions (named deep SOD). To enable in-depth understanding of deep SOD, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey covering various aspects, ranging from algorithm taxonomy to unsolved issues. In particular, we first review deep SOD algorithms from different perspectives, including network architecture, level of supervision, learning paradigm, and object-/instance-level detection. Following that, we summarize and analyze existing SOD datasets and evaluation metrics. Then, we benchmark a large group of representative SOD models, and provide detailed analyses of the comparison results. Moreover, we study the performance of SOD algorithms under different attribute settings, which has not been thoroughly explored previously, by constructing a novel SOD dataset with rich attribute annotations covering various salient object types, challenging factors, and scene categories. We further analyze, for the first time in the field, the robustness of SOD models to random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. We also look into the generalization and difficulty of existing SOD datasets. Finally, we discuss several open issues of SOD and outline future research directions. All the saliency prediction maps, our constructed dataset with annotations, and codes for evaluation are publicly available at https://github.com/wenguanwang/SODsurvey .",
